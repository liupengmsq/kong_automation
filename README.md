npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
npm install mocha @types/mocha --save-dev
npm install chai@4.3.10 @types/chai@4.3.10 --save-dev
npm install mochawesome --save-dev
```

## Step 3: Initialize TypeScript Configuration
Run the following command to generate `tsconfig.json`:
```bash
npx tsc --init
```

## Step 4: Install Required Browser Binaries
```bash
npx playwright install

# Design Consideration

1. **Toolchain Selection:**
   - *Playwright:* Chosen for its robust capabilities in browser automation and testing.
   - *TypeScript:* Selected to enhance code quality through static typing and improved readability.
   - *Mocha and Chai:* Utilized for their flexibility and expressiveness in writing and structuring tests.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Organized into directories such as `components`, `entities`, `pages`, `tests`, and `utils` to promote modularity and ease of maintenance.

3. **Testing Framework:**
   - Mocha was integrated as the test runner, with Chai providing assertion capabilities, facilitating clear and concise test definitions.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Incorporated `mochawesome` to generate comprehensive HTML test reports, aiding in result analysis and debugging.
